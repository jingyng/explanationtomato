Your task will be to evaluate the quality of the <b>Explanation</b>. </li> <li>There are three types of relationships between the <b>Hypothesis-Premise</b> pair: (i)<b> contradiction</b>, (ii) <b>neutral</b>, or (iii) <b>entailment</b>. The three different Relationships mean the following:</li> <ul><li><b>Entailment</b>: There is <b>enough evidence</b> in <b>Premise</b> to conclude that <b>Hypothesis</b> is <b>true</b>.</li> <li><b>Contradiction</b>: There is <b>enough evidence</b> in <b>Premise</b> to conclude that <b>Hypothesis</b> is <b>false</b>.</li> <li><b>Neutral</b>: The evidence in <b>Premise</b> is <b>insufficient</b> to draw a conclusion about <b>Hypothesis</b>.</li> </ul> <li>You will then answer three evaluation questions:</li> <ul><li>Do you agree with the given <b>Relationship</b> between the <b>Hypothesis</b> and <b>Premise</b> (you might have different oppinions about their Relationship)? Please notice that sometimes you will see <b>not entailment</b>, consider this Relationship as the opposite of <b>entailment</b> that could be either <b>contradiction</b> or <b>neutral</b> Relationship, i.e., if you think it's either <b>contradiction</b> or <b>neutral</b> and you see <b>not entailment</b>, consider it to be correct.</li> <li> Given the Hypothesis and Premise, does the <b>Explanation</b> justify the given <b>Relationship</b>?</li> <li>What are the shortcomings of the <b>Explanation</b>?</li></ul> An explanation justifies an answer if: <ul><li>it is easily understood,</li> <li>it provides all important reasons and implications behind the justification,</li> <li>does NOT just repeat or restate (one of) the given sentences.</li></ul> <ol></p>"]}
{"id":"3","text":"Tips:","schema": "pure_display", "choices": ["<ul><li>Minor grammatical and style errors should be ignored (e.g. case sensitivity, missing periods, a missing pronoun etc.).</li> <li>A good approach to evaluating explanations is the following: Before looking at the explanations, think of an explanation you would give to someone in a conversation and then anchor your assessments based on that.</li></ul>"]}
