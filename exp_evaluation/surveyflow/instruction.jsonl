The three different answer options mean the following:</li> <ul><li><b>Entailment</b>: There is enough evidence in <b>Premise</b> to conclude that <b>Hypothesis</b> is true.</li> <li><b>Contradiction</b>: There is enough evidence in <b>Premise</b> to conclude that <b>Hypothesis</b> is false.</li> <li><b>Neutral</b>: The evidence in <b>Premise</b> is insufficient to draw a conclusion about <b>Hypothesis</b>.</li> </ul> <li>You will then answer two evaluation questions:</li> <ul><li>Given the <b>Hypothesis</b> and <b>Premise</b>, does the <b>Explanation</b> justify the answer?</li> <li>If any, what are the shortcomings of the <b>Explanation</b>?</li></ul> An explanation justifies an answer if: <ul><li>it is easily understood,</li> <li>it provides all important reasons and implications behind the justification,</li> <li>does NOT just restate (one of) the given sentences.</li></ul> <ol></p>"]}
{"id":"3","text":"Tips:","schema": "pure_display", "choices": ["<ul><li>Minor grammatical and style errors should be ignored (e.g. case sensitivity, missing periods, a missing pronoun etc.).</li> <li>IMPORTANT: An explanation that just repeats or restates (one of) the sentences is NOT a valid explanation.</li> <li>A good approach to evaluating explanations is the following: Before looking at the explanations, think of an explanation you would give to someone in a conversation and then anchor your assessments based on that.</li></ul>"]}
