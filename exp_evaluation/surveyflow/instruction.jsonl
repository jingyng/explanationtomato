Your task is to evaluate the quality of the <b>Explanation</b>. </li> <li>There are three types of relationships between the <b>Hypothesis-Premise</b> pair: (i)<b> contradiction</b>, (ii) <b>neutral</b>, or (iii) <b>entailment</b>. The three different Relationships mean the following:</li> <ul><li><b>Entailment</b>: There is <b>enough evidence</b> in <b>Premise</b> to conclude that <b>Hypothesis</b> is <b>true</b>.</li> <li><b>Contradiction</b>: There is <b>enough evidence</b> in <b>Premise</b> to conclude that <b>Hypothesis</b> is <b>false</b>.</li> <li><b>Neutral</b>: The evidence in <b>Premise</b> is <b>insufficient</b> to draw a conclusion about <b>Hypothesis</b>.</li> </ul> <li>You will then answer two evaluation questions:</li> <ul> <li> Given the Hypothesis and Premise, does the <b>Explanation</b> justify the given <b>Relationship</b>?</li> <li>What are the shortcomings of the <b>Explanation</b>?</li></ul> An explanation justifies an answer if: <ul><li>it is easily understood,</li> <li>it provides all important reasons and implications behind the justification,</li> <li>does NOT just repeat or restate (one of) the given sentences.</li></ul> <ol></p>"]}
