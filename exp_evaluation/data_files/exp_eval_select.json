These include basic metals, chemicals and wood. The Welsh government called on Westminster to address the impact of high energy prices on industry. The UK government has been asked to comment. Plaid said Gross Value Added (GVA) figures -  which measure the value of goods and services produced - show the so-called foundation industries in Wales have suffered a 39% decline in the five years to 2013. Mr ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to take action to help industries combat high energy costs. He said: \"Figures show that the threat to our economy runs far deeper than steel, but affects the range of industries that our economy is built upon. \"This includes the chemical industry, other metals, and wood products. Wales' foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline.\" He said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry. A Welsh government spokesman said: \"No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government. \"We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem. \"The economy minister has set-up an industry-led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries.\" Pro Steel Engineering in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is only three years old but has benefited from contracts in London, including the new Olympic Stadium roof in London for West Ham United and strengthening the Hammersmith fly-over. Director Richard Selby said: \"We're fortunate we're expanding and are hoping to start recruiting in a couple of months and we have a full order book. \"We've had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities. \"But the foundation industries need a lot more support, particularly with the energy costs we have, and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive.\" Economist Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University, said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic. But he said Wales' growth areas had been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services and the public sector. \"We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales' economic destiny as we'd like to see it,\" he said. \"Of course, on current structures they can't, they simply aren't like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways. \"A back office for a bank simply can't do the same things for Wales, no matter how many bums on seats there are in those call centres. They don't provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision.\" Prof Jones said the steel industry in Wales had done relatively well to avoid the worst of the crisis so far. \"There have been big rounds of redundancies over the last 30 years and we've a very lean operation in Wales and geographically we're better placed than those steelworks in the north of England and Scotland.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> cymru: steel's troubles are a \"canary in the mine\" spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth warned steel's troubles were a \"canary in the mine\" warning of deeper problems across a range of industries."}

Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is \"ridiculous\". A new release date has yet to be announced.   The live-action remake was granted a \"P13 parental guidance classification\". \"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened,\" LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said. \"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction.

Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the \"exclusively gay moment\" in the film. It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it \"stupid and laughable\". \"Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes,\" wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.

At a previous hearing, Mr Fidler, 66, had been told to tear down his home by 6 June or face jail. On Monday, Stephen Whale, counsel for Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, told the judge that Mr Fidler had made \"very good progress in terms of complying with the requirements of the enforcement notices\", but that he had not \"fully complied with the requirements\". The house had been \"very largely\" demolished, he said, but there was \"still more to be done\", including restoring the land to its former agricultural use.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was \"another of these secret trials\". He said: \"Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype. \"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. \"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a \"prisoner of conscience\" who was being held for \"peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association\".

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a un conference in geneva on wednesday does not imply that the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead."}

{"id":"86","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the wake of donald trump's decision to leave the eu, there is no doubt that the us should not be allowed to leave the country.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the \"Remain Campaign\" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's \"Climate Brexit\" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. \"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. \"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

{"id":"118","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. \u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the iphone is not the same as the iphone t."}

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the exhibition features 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000."}

In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL.

{"id":"174","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst. The sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears. Cynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia. There have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings. But when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure. \"I'm fine, thanks.\" \"Everything is fine now.\" \"Thank you for asking.\" I am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable. I couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women. These feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity. They are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border. But elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality. Al-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back. Perhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax. At Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\" And yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon. For two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy. But Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya. Then, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast. Troops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords. Since then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya. Revenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere. Then there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation. It has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast. And then there is Greater Somalia. It is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa. Al-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges. By attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area. Not that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite. Yes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town. Surely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support. But overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the militants are not promoting greater somalia."}

{"id":"184","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet''in the system of a tax on the system.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the labels are not necessarily bollywood ones."}

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012\/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was \"fairly obvious grandstanding\" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. \"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,\" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of \"waving through the government's plans\" and \"lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit\". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: \"The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.\" But the Labour source predicted \"residual tensions\", adding: \"I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering. \"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> dem leader nick clegg has urged the lib dems to guarantee'' the government's future in the house of lords."}

{"id":"281","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the wake of donald trump's decision to leave the eu, there is no doubt that the us should not be allowed to leave the country.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the \"Remain Campaign\" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's \"Climate Brexit\" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. \"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. \"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.

She had been a \"guiding example\" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had \"failed completely\" to report the birthday in a way that was \"fair, balanced and proportionate\".<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> william has paid tribute to the queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. he said she had been a \"guiding example\" of what a good monarch should be. ten stamps have been released to mark the monarch's birthday."}

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was \"fairly obvious grandstanding\" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. \"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,\" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of \"waving through the government's plans\" and \"lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit\". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: \"The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.\" But the Labour source predicted \"residual tensions\", adding: \"I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering. \"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> nick clegg is not the same as lord oates."}

It was one of the first directives President Barack Obama ordered two months after he was elected in 2008. Inmates have slowly been transferred out and at the start of the year, 122 men were left. The peak population in 2003 was 684.

Some have been considered too dangerous to be released, but the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them. The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries, a process Mr Earnest said needs to continue if the facility is to shut.

Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up. But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win. The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015. Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties. More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up. However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break. Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship. England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012\/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures. But Hanson Academy claims it \"communicated clearly\" its expectations for this school year. Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers. Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed. Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday. She said in an earlier statement: \"We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted. \"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason. \"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.\" The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for \"adult life\". She said: \"This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect. \"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other. \"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school.\" Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes. She said: \"It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather.\" She said buying new shoes was not an easy option. \"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important.\" Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps. \"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes,\" she said. Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home. Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: \"Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00. \"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon.\" The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.

She had been a \"guiding example\" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.

{"id":"365","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> in the wake of donald trump's decision to leave the eu, there is no doubt that the us should not be allowed to leave the country.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> The secretary of state was, by all accounts, a member of the \"Remain Campaign\" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. So President Trump's \"Climate Brexit\" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not. It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy. How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile. Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\". Tillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement. But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony. Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \"maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand\". No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments. But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House. Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement. Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map. The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement. Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck. \"We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,\" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration. \"We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.\" To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty. But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on. So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.

Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: \"For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. \"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. \"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism.\" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will \"consider all options\" for the frigates to ensure \"best financial return for the taxpayer\". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to \"commercial sensitivity\". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems. They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.

Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is \"ridiculous\". A new release date has yet to be announced.

In an editorial, the newspaper said the \"ruthlessly effective\" policy was \"inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war\". It said it would be \"unconscionable\" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested. Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was \"very sad\". \"If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats,\" he told ABC Radio. \"Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats.\" On Thursday, Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State (IS), from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing, was worse than the Nazis. \"The Nazis did terrible evil, but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it,\" he told Sydney Radio 2GB. But IS militants, he said, \"boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing\". The Executive Council of Australian Jewry Robert Goot said the comment was \"injudicious and unfortunate\", saying there was \"a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy\". \"The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder,\" he told Australian media.

{"id":"400","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet''in the system of a tax on the system.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet. \"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. \"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\". He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. \"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the scottish government considers the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair.\""}

Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures. But Hanson Academy claims it \"communicated clearly\" its expectations for this school year. Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers. Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed. Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday. She said in an earlier statement: \"We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted. \"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason. \"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.\" The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for \"adult life\". She said: \"This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect. \"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other. \"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school.\" Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes. She said: \"It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather.\" She said buying new shoes was not an easy option. \"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important.\" Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps. \"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes,\" she said. Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home. Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: \"Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00. \"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon.\" The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.

{"id":"427","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. \u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.

Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been \"changed forever\". \"It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,\" she said. \"My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared.\" \"We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder,\" she added. \"Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. \"The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more.\" Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August. HSE inspector Julian Franklin said it was \"an extremely tragic case\" and described Green's behaviour as \"reckless\".<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> entailment<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> Green, 51, admitted causing the death of a cyclist by careless driving. court told he was more than two times the legal driving limit. he was jailed for 16 months and two weeks at Leeds Crown Court."}

{"id":"433","text":"<strong>Hypothesis:<\/strong> india's famous bollywood labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra for the first time.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:<\/strong> My sources include collectors all over the world, dealers, auctions, flea markets, and just about any place I can think of. The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:<\/strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> not all labels are famous."}

He told Mr Justice Dove at London's High Court that his \"beautiful home\" had now been \"carefully dismantled\". \"Hopefully, it will be rebuilt on another site with full planning permission,\" he said. At a previous hearing, Mr Fidler, 66, had been told to tear down his home by 6 June or face jail. On Monday, Stephen Whale, counsel for Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, told the judge that Mr Fidler had made \"very good progress in terms of complying with the requirements of the enforcement notices\", but that he had not \"fully complied with the requirements\". The house had been \"very largely\" demolished, he said, but there was \"still more to be done\", including restoring the land to its former agricultural use. He said the \"technical legal position\" was that Mr Fidler remained in contempt of court, but the parties had agreed for the matter to be adjourned for a month to give him \"an opportunity completely to comply\". Representing himself, Mr Fidler insisted: \"I broke no law. I was looking after my family. I acted in good faith. I am a law-abiding citizen.\" He described the four bedroom castle as a \"work of art built lawfully\", but said he would \"fully comply\" with the council enforcement notices. Mr Justice Dove adjourned the case until 4 July, but said he hoped it would not be necessary for it to return to court.
