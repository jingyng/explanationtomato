Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.\nAndrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\n\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"\nHe said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\n\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\n\"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"\nThe study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.\nDr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside.

They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out.\nWhile Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service.\nThat meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker.\nSeveral hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's \"forensic\" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad.\nElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was \"the only one able to do that\".\nHe has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used.\n\"I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,\" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account.\n\"The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.\"\nHowever, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system.\n\"The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,\" he said.\n\"And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back.\n\"Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies.\"\nBut another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test.\n\"We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\"It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it.\n\"And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too.\"\nApple has told the Wall Street Journal that it \"plans to more aggressively encourage people\" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords.\n\"When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,\" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper.\n\"I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up.

Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.\nAndrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\n\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory.

But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"\nThe study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.\nDr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside.

Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.\nAt the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.\nRules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\nDuring his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\nThe NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.\nBut Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\".\nBennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.\n\"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.\n\"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer.\n\"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself.\n\"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\"\nMcGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier.\nSince sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\"\nHe also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73.\nCortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> lighter gloves mean more punishing punches.

It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.\nThey used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.\nThe rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.\nSometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.\nIt seems like a nightmare now.\nI remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.\nIf they said: \"We don't have food\", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.\nSometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.\nI was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.\nLuckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.\nI lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.\nFortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.\nHe encouraged me saying: \"You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.\"\nAt the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.\nRichard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.\nHe passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.\nWhen the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.\nWe were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.\nThrough this so many lives were saved.\nThere were three key activities.\nWe started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.\nWe educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.\nSecondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.\nThirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.\nPeople were frightened.\nSometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.\nIt was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.\nOne of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.\nThere were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.\nWhen I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.\nWe didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.\nNow I see my life as a changed person.\nI regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.\nWe are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.\nIf we invest in them then we are building the future.\n11,314\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n4,808 Liberia\n3,955 Sierra Leone\n2,536 Guinea\n8 Nigeria<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> he was kidnapped by the rebels and taken to the jungle where he was trained to use a gun. he was also given drugs and told if you were brave you would climb up the ranks. he was also forced to kill, which he did under the influence of drugs."}

The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves.\nU33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships.\nTheir task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker.\nWhen they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search.\nHe says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity.\nThere have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK.\nHe says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\".\nFor the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy.\nIt has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope.\nDown below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors.\nLieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship.\nHe says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines.\nBut when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\"\nNato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy.\nBut this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength.\nWhile many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his.\nRussia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters.\nEarlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\".\nPeter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development.\nHe describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled.\nThey are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\".\nWhen out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time.\nOften the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves.\nThey lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships.\nFor this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search.\nFor the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean.\nScientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed.\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea.\nRyan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise.\nThey are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance.\nUnderwater drones are for the future.\nBut for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft.\nThese are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean.\nFor this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft.\nInside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below.\nBritain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences.\nSeveral times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters.\nRUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\".\nHe says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland.\nBritain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare.\nBut it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone.\nThe lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.\nThe search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the fact that uk no longer has any maritime patrol aircraft does not imply that the royal navy's most powerful naval ship, it, is on the verge of becoming the first naval vessel to be conducted in the uk."}

Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.\nBut why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?\nWell it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.\nSurely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.\nPresumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (\"there is no alternative\").\nWhat is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.\nWorse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.\nNot that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).\nThere is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.\nSo for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.\nMany would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.\nSo if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the new eurozone president is not in the hands of the rest of europe."}

Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.\nAndrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\n\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"\nHe said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\n\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\n\"It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.\"\nThe study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.\nDr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: \"The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> women are not men."}

Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.\nAt the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.\nRules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.\n\"Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,\" said Bennett. \"To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.\"\nDuring his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: \"I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.\"\nThe NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.\nMcGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.\nBut Bennett says he studied a \"litany of information\" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \"several reasons to approve the fight\".\nBennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.\n\"I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,\" said Bennett. \"He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.\n\"Then you put Nate in the ring with Conor and Conor knocks him down with several shots. Add in that Conor has a granite-like chin, add in that he's 12 years younger than Floyd, and add in that he's taller and longer.\n\"Floyd is probably one of the smartest fighters, he has the art of getting in getting shots and getting out. But he hasn't knocked anyone out in 10 years. Ricky Hatton was probably the last one in 2007 because when he KO'd Victor Ortiz in 2010, he wasn't defending himself.\n\"That in essence is it. There were several reasons to approve this fight.\"\nMcGregor floored Diaz three times on his way to a points win in August 2016, avenging a defeat via submission five months earlier.\nSince sanctioning the fight, Bennett has had access to three videos showing McGregor's progress and told BBC Sport: \"He's good to go.\"\nHe also advised McGregor's camp to employ a boxing referee in order to feel comfortable with the rules, advice which led to the hiring of Hall of Fame official Joe Cortez, 73.\nCortez said he oversaw an \"out of control\" sparring session between McGregor and Paulie Malignaggi. The former two-weight world champion has since left the camp after reacting angrily to images of him on the canvas during a sparring session.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the ufc featherweight champion is not able to defend his ufc lightweight title against nate diaz if he submitted a necessary waiver to the nac on wednesday."}

We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.\"\nBut Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.\nTory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.\nThere is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.\n\"So long as Britain is in an economic crisis\", says Tim Montgomerie, \"every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.\"\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST\nDownload the Analysis podcast\nListen via the Radio 4 website\nFollow Analysis on Facebook\nLast month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.\nThe meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for \"new thinking\" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.\nOne of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described \"this in-or-out discussion\" as \"a bit crude\", and said she thinks the choice is between \"the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship\".\nThe wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.\nAlmost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.\nThat in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.\nFormer Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply \"wave goodbye\" altogether.\nAnd Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.\nIt is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.\nThose MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.\nAnalysis is on BBC Radio 4 on Monday 17 October at 20:30 BST and Sunday 23 October at 21:30 BST.

Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote.\nRenato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\".\nMr Renzi wants to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.\nCurrently, legislation is often held up because identical versions of bills have to be approved by both houses.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61."}

There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland.\n\"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\".\nHe welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign.\nThere were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\".\nHe then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\"\nAnd the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\".\nHe concluded his address by saying: \"Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament.\n\"There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country.\n\"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\".\nMs Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\".\nThe presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999.\nMr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system.\nHe said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary.\n\"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\"\nHe recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster.\nBut Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\"\nFormer Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.\nIn her speech, she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney, especially \"his huge outbursts of faux indignation\".<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> if the presiding officer was moved to tears, then it is likely that she had to address the scottish parliament."}

I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.\n\"I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes.\n\"If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms.\nShe told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret, meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules.\nGoogle, most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland, is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK.\nLast week, European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an \"automatic information exchange between tax authorities\" to monitor the situation.\nThe Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks, rather than where products are consumed.\nHe has also called for a debate on international tax reform.\n\"Politicians - not companies - [should] set the rules...When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands, it's a confusing spectacle for everyone,\" he recently wrote in the Observer.\n\"Our hope is to move the debate forward, with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer, simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:<\/strong> the uk's tax rules are not the same as the uk's tax laws."}
