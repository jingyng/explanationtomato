Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been \"changed forever\". \"It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,\" she said. \"My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared.\" \"We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder,\" she added. \"Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. \"The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more.\" Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August. HSE inspector Julian Franklin said it was \"an extremely tragic case\" and described Green's behaviour as \"reckless\".<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  cyclist Harry Whitlam died after he was reversed into by a tractor at Swithens Farm, Rothwell, near Leeds, in august 2013.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 34s "}}

Finances became a concern when a planned \u00a37.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  \"The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. \"We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable.\" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining \"high quality care for local people\" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: \"People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. \"We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  monitor is looking into the financial sustainability of southend university hospital foundation trust \"on behalf of patients\"", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 58s "}}
