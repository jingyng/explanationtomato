{"id": "187", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the all progressives congress is the main opposition party.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Does not make sense (nonsensical)": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}

{"id": "128", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> st johnstone eased to victory over 10-man inverness caledonian thistle to move off the bottom of the scottish premiership.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone. ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. \"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. \"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. \"You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clich\u00e9s, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. \"I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. \"But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).
