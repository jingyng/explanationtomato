She had been a \"guiding example\" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an \"important landmark\", adding the monarch had served the nation with \"dignity\". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: \"The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be.\" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as \"work-shy William\". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. \"I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,\" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a \"work shy\" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised \"but it's not something I take completely to heart\". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was \"the best role model I could have in front of me\". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday \"does not warrant this kind of coverage\" and that the BBC had a \"duty to report, not to celebrate the royals\".

Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.
