{"id": "308", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow \"real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,\" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Too trivial (only repeating one of the sentences)": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}

{"id": "355", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet''in the system of a tax on the system.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet. \"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. \"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\". He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. \"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  a review for the commission on local tax reform said there was no'magic bullet' to cure defects in the system.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 35s "}}
