The museum's director, Brian Oldman, said the opal's rarity should not be underestimated. \"Opal of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions,\" Mr Oldman said. \"When our state's inland sea evaporated millions of years ago, it provided a unique silica-rich environment for the creation of precious opal.
