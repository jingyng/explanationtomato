The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused. The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre. Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956. The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council. County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an \"exciting step forward\". He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion. He added: \"It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area.\" The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land. Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..

Backers, including Blaenau Gwent council, have offered around 320 hectares (800 acres) replacement land.

Natural Resources Wales said it was \"difficult to conclude\" that the replacement land was of equal value, but it was not opposing the development overall. But an ecology report presented by the developers said there would be a \"net gain\" in biodiversity because the plans included work to enhance other habitats nearby - which the Gwent wildlife trust argued against.
