Mr Walls told the BBC Scotland news website how he took photographs of a hen party, stag do, football fans, a chef, a high court judge and a TV agony aunt from Kuwait. He said: \"Everyone was so nice. One of the pictures is of a passenger who was in such a hurry that he couldn't wait for another taxi when I discovered the central locking system was broken so I had to pull him in and out of the taxi window. \"I also had an elderly former English teacher who had suddenly decided she wanted to go out to a show at the festival at the last minute and she had lots of words of encouragement for me so I really enjoyed chatting with her. \"I also got a Jambo fan and was worried I wasn't going to get a Hibs fan but luckily I did. \"I'm really interested in people and wanted to capture that moment in my cab, I only had seconds to take a few pictures and I'm really pleased with the end result.\" The exhibition runs from 31 July until 5 August.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  just because he took pictures of 101 passengers does not mean he took thousands of people to a festival.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 57s "}}
