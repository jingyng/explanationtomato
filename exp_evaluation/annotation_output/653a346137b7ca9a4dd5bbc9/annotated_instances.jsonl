{"id": "343", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> barrow and barrow played out a goalless draw in the fa cup first round.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Media playback is not supported on this device Eighth-tier Taunton were playing their ninth game in this season's competition and were the lowest-ranked side left after Westfields' exit on Monday. Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.
