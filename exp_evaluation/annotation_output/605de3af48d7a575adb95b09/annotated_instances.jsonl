{"id": "295", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: \"The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. \"This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \"Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. \"The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a \u00c2\u00a3296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 35s "}}

{"id": "221", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> india's famous bollywood labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra for the first time.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> My sources include collectors all over the world, dealers, auctions, flea markets, and just about any place I can think of. The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  not all of my labels are from the western state of maharashtra. some are from the 1920s and 30s and some are even from the 1950s and 60s.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"No": "4"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 30s "}}

It was part of an event where 250 schoolchildren were introduced to music in front of the Duke and Duchess. The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening, after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday. On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony. The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra. Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone. Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg. Prince George tried on a pilot's helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit. The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot. Antoine van Gent, head of flight testing at Airbus, said: \"The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses. \"George was excited, with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one, he already knew there was a difference between them.\" Charlotte was less impressed after taking a tumble on the concrete after leaving the aircraft but Mr van Gent said she enjoyed playing in the pilot's seat.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the duke and duchess of cambridge are in hamburg.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Yes": "1"}, "reason": {"None (only if the previous answer is Yes)": "6"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 36s "}}
