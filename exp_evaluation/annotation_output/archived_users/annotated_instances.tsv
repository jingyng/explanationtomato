Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. ""We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  monitor is the health watchdog."					2				4	2

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the bills are directly linked to the situation in Ukraine. they would be triggered by a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders. there are already many Russian citizens in Crimea, and a majority hold Russian passports."				1				6

5e555c2280c35054d481ab71	190	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst. The sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears. Cynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia. There have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings. But when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure. ""I'm fine, thanks."" ""Everything is fine now."" ""Thank you for asking."" I am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable. I couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women. These feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity. They are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border. But elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality. Al-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back. Perhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax. At Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: ""Oh, I thought you were carrying guns."" And yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon. For two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy. But Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya. Then, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast. Troops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with ""friendly"" warlords. Since then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya. Revenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere. Then there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation. It has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast. And then there is Greater Somalia. It is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa. Al-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges. By attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area. Not that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite. Yes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town. Surely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support. But overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the militants are not promoting greater somalia."			4							2	1

61115e026711eecf59e0e7ee	13	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> prince william has said she is ``incredibly important''to be the queen's 90th birthday, as he celebrates her 90th birthday.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had ""failed completely"" to report the birthday in a way that was ""fair, balanced and proportionate"".<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the prince is paying tribute to the queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. he said she has been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be. the queen will walk around Windsor on her actual birthday on Thursday."					2				4

It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the APC won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since 1999."				1				6

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had ""failed completely"" to report the birthday in a way that was ""fair, balanced and proportionate"".<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  william said the Queen was a 'guiding example' of what a good monarch should be. he said she has been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch could be. the prince said he does not take criticisms of his royal duties too seriously."				1				6

6138a19656f61eebb39bf85a	324	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the iphone is not the same as the iphone t."				1				6

He told Mr Justice Dove at London's High Court that his ""beautiful home"" had now been ""carefully dismantled"". ""Hopefully, it will be rebuilt on another site with full planning permission,"" he said. At a previous hearing, Mr Fidler, 66, had been told to tear down his home by 6 June or face jail. On Monday, Stephen Whale, counsel for Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, told the judge that Mr Fidler had made ""very good progress in terms of complying with the requirements of the enforcement notices"", but that he had not ""fully complied with the requirements"". The house had been ""very largely"" demolished, he said, but there was ""still more to be done"", including restoring the land to its former agricultural use. He said the ""technical legal position"" was that Mr Fidler remained in contempt of court, but the parties had agreed for the matter to be adjourned for a month to give him ""an opportunity completely to comply"". Representing himself, Mr Fidler insisted: ""I broke no law. I was looking after my family. I acted in good faith. I am a law-abiding citizen."" He described the four bedroom castle as a ""work of art built lawfully"", but said he would ""fully comply"" with the council enforcement notices. Mr Justice Dove adjourned the case until 4 July, but said he hoped it would not be necessary for it to return to court. Mr Fidler told him: ""I assure you we will not have to come back."" At the end of the hearing, he said to the judge: ""When I rebuild my house, I want you to come and see it.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the court cannot decide whether a farmer who built a mock-tudor castle without planning permission is to return to his home."					2							3

But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said.

It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.""

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a un conference in geneva on wednesday does not imply that the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead."				1				6

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  president sepp blatter is a dual nationality - Swiss and italian. he is also one of five presidential candidates vying to replace Blatter."			4						4			3

Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been ""changed forever"". ""It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,"" she said. ""My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared."" ""We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder,"" she added. ""Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. ""The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more."" Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August.

Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the iphone is not the same as the iphone t."					2					2

And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  party A Just Russia put forward both bills. one would speed up procedures for issuing Russian passports."				1				6

The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre. Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956. The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council. County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an ""exciting step forward"".

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the us has suspended talks with russia over a cessation of hostilities in syria. the us has blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians."				1				6

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  a review for the commission on local tax reform said there was no'magic bullet' to cure defects in the system."				1				6

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead."			4						4

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the current council tax system is unfair because it is not linked to current income."				1				6

It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the all progressives congress is the main opposition party."				1				6

Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance.

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

6413599b9578c7f923d4b2c2	382	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the APC won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since 1999."				1				6

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"".

On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony. The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra. Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone. Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had ""failed completely"" to report the birthday in a way that was ""fair, balanced and proportionate"".<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  prince william has said the queen has been a 'guiding example' of what a good monarch should be, in a bbc interview. he said he did not take criticisms of his royal duties ""to heart""."			4				5		4			3

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  india's famous bollywood labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra for the first time."				1				6

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead."				1				6

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

60bcdcab851b473fd30718d4	304	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.""

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.

60bcdcab851b473fd30718d4	463	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> a row has broken out over whether sepp blatter should be replaced by a member of world governing body fifa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  president sepp blatter is a dual nationality - Swiss and italian. he is also one of five presidential candidates vying to replace Blatter."			4				5

Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces.

Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. ""We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  monitor is looking into the financial sustainability of southend university hospital foundation trust ""on behalf of patients""."						3						3
60fbdeb5f768b08e43b60690	91	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> a row has broken out over whether sepp blatter should be replaced by a member of world governing body fifa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the fact that Domenico Scala is a dual Swiss/Italian national does not result in a conflict of interest.

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  not all of my labels are from the western state of maharashtra. some are from the 1920s and 30s and some are even from the 1950s and 60s."				1							1	3

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the APC won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since 1999."				1				6

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  not all labels are famous."						3				2

Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance.

6554d5f1a5b42aea269aa82a	304	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  boys from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."			4								1

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships. The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted. Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: ""For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. ""My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. ""We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism."" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will ""consider all options"" for the frigates to ensure ""best financial return for the taxpayer"". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to ""commercial sensitivity"". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems. They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.

60c674ca5f64d6fe32497dfc	387	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> one of the world's most popular infectiously-catchy, infectiously-catchy, has been hit by a video on social media.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Infectiously-catchy earworm 'PPAP' (short for Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen') was performed by animal print-clad DJ Piko-Taro, a fictional character played by Japanese entertainer Kazuhiko Kosaka. And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

60c674ca5f64d6fe32497dfc	352	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  steve jobs has been a success, but the iphone has not."						3	5			2	1

5e9ddc3874ce0b13aa6ca975	463	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> a row has broken out over whether sepp blatter should be replaced by a member of world governing body fifa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  president sepp blatter is a dual nationality - Swiss and italian. he is also one of five presidential candidates vying to replace Blatter."			4				5				1

The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

6145dddfa6fcfd396e1f4f1a	4	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  is becoming a safer place to live, according to new research. boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts."						3			4

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."" But the Labour source predicted ""residual tensions"", adding: ""I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering.

615200d54efc832849db2259	469	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the us says it has suspended talks with russia over a cessation of hostilities in syria.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

The house had been ""very largely"" demolished, he said, but there was ""still more to be done"", including restoring the land to its former agricultural use.

Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance. ""We have launched this investigation to find out more about the financial situation at the trust and to establish what can be done to improve things.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  monitor is the health watchdog."				1				6

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.

And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

615dfa409d28374d872b9fe5	324	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the iphone is not the same as the iphone t."				1				6

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a un conference in geneva on wednesday does not imply that the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead."			4							2

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  domenico scala is a dual swiss-italian national, as is gianni infantino, one of the five presidential candidates for sepp blatter's position as president. he has been barred from sitting as a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee because of his nationality."					2					2

Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships. The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted. Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: ""For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. ""My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. ""We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism."" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will ""consider all options"" for the frigates to ensure ""best financial return for the taxpayer"". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to ""commercial sensitivity"". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems. They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.

And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the scottish government has been accused of no magic bullet'' in the system of a tax on the system."				1				6

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday."			4							2

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  a review for the commission on local tax reform said there was no'magic bullet' to cure defects in the system."				1				6

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in ""secret"". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was ""another of these secret trials"". He said: ""Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome ""might come today, it might come next week"". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was ""more fight in her"" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was ""unpredictable"" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""I have watched her grow up on Skype. ""She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. ""Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a ""prisoner of conscience"" who was being held for ""peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association"". Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: ""Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  sentenced to five years in jail for allegedly plotting to topple the government in tehran does not indicate that iran's ex-wife has called on the british government to appeal against her jailed sentence for plotting mass murder in tehran."				1				6

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"".

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the scottish government has been accused of no magic bullet'' in the system of a tax on the system."				1				6

The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra. Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone. Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg. Prince George tried on a pilot's helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit. The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot. Antoine van Gent, head of flight testing at Airbus, said: ""The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses. ""George was excited, with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one, he already knew there was a difference between them.""

The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.

Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.

652d37c951960563bb60e8a4	75	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the all progressives congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the peoples democratic party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999."				1				6

61365ba03be7b1ff2c809e92	295	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."			4									3

And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner.

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had ""failed completely"" to report the birthday in a way that was ""fair, balanced and proportionate"".<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  a picture of the queen, prince of wales, prince william and prince george has been released to mark the queen's 90th birthday."				1				6

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan. The hospital blamed the larger-than-anticipated deficit on growth in demand and increased staff recruitment. Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance.

5e4aa8632301e7000b5791a7	304	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  boys from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increases the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."					2				4			3

570e14beceaf25000d141f5c	205	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> st johnstone eased to victory over 10-man inverness caledonian thistle to move off the bottom of the scottish premiership.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone. ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

570e14beceaf25000d141f5c	190	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst. The sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears. Cynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia. There have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings. But when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure. ""I'm fine, thanks."" ""Everything is fine now."" ""Thank you for asking."" I am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable. I couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women. These feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity. They are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border. But elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality. Al-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back. Perhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax. At Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: ""Oh, I thought you were carrying guns."" And yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon. For two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy. But Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya. Then, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast. Troops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with ""friendly"" warlords. Since then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya. Revenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere. Then there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation. It has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast. And then there is Greater Somalia. It is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa. Al-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges. By attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area. Not that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite. Yes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town. Surely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support. But overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the militants are not promoting greater somalia."			4									3

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday."				1				6

60d1b7642d082fa4cebddfd2	315	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> more than half of schools in england are using tablet computers, according to a study from the university of cambridge.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  schools are using tablet computers to some extent. but there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices."				1				6

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"".

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  not all labels are famous."			4								1

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.

It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.""

But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.""

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

56b6e2fcf2fc70000c32f9d5	315	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> more than half of schools in england are using tablet computers, according to a study from the university of cambridge.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  schools are using tablet computers to some extent. but there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices."			4									3

It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the APC won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since 1999."				1				6

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."				1				6

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  not all of my labels are from the western state of maharashtra. some are from the 1920s and 30s and some are even from the 1950s and 60s."			4							2

Finances became a concern when a planned £7.8m deficit grew, for which Monitor could see no recovery plan.

Hospital chairman Alan Tobias OBE, said:  ""The overspend is a result of vital investment in services and more staff to ensure high standards of patient care as well as the rise in attendances. ""We welcome this review to clearly demonstrate to Monitor - as well as patients and stakeholders - our future financial plans are both robust and sustainable."" The hospital has pledged to cut the deficit while maintaining ""high quality care for local people"" and said it was committed to returning to a surplus within three years. Monitor said its investigation will look into the state of the hospital trust's finances, assess the strength of its financial management and explore ways of improving its sustainability, on behalf of patients across the region. The investigation will also examine how the trust works with other local health and care organisations to respond to the financial challenges it faces. Katherine Cawley, regional director at Monitor, said: ""People are relying on Southend to provide them with quality healthcare now and in the future, and we are concerned that this may be at risk because of the trust's poor financial performance.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday."				1				6

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  if the ad-hoc electoral committee has a conflict of interest, then a row has broken out."					2		5

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

6159f81f78b651e217141715	200	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  if the people are in poverty, they are more likely to be victims of crime."				1				6

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had ""failed completely"" to report the birthday in a way that was ""fair, balanced and proportionate"".<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  prince william has said the queen has been a 'guiding example' of what a good monarch should be, in a bbc interview. he said he did not take criticisms of his royal duties ""to heart""."						3				2

APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the all progressives congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the peoples democratic party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999."			4						4	2

Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been ""changed forever"". ""It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,"" she said. ""My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared."" ""We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder,"" she added. ""Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. ""The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more."" Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in ""secret"". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was ""another of these secret trials"". He said: ""Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome ""might come today, it might come next week"". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was ""more fight in her"" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was ""unpredictable"" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""I have watched her grow up on Skype. ""She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. ""Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a ""prisoner of conscience"" who was being held for ""peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association"". Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: ""Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  sentenced to five years in jail for allegedly plotting to topple the government in tehran does not indicate that iran's ex-wife has called on the british government to appeal against her jailed sentence for plotting mass murder in tehran."					2			6

60a280d663834ecd8d6a7e86	324	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the iphone t in the park have been making headlines'time at this time of year, but steve jobs has been a success.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. “Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?” This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the iphone is not the same as the iphone t."					2			6

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

5f018e821fca9b2dd567fc34	154	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> a row has broken out over whether sepp blatter should be replaced by a member of world governing body fifa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  if the ad-hoc electoral committee has a conflict of interest, then a row has broken out."			4				5					
5f018e821fca9b2dd567fc34	170	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet''in the system of a tax on the system.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no ""magic bullet"" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the council tax has built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers."						3			4

5f69bca68bd61e01afde8d9b	4	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  is becoming a safer place to live, according to new research. boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts."				1				6

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars. MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board. Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations. This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau. The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered. Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time. The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane. Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."" The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines. These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a un conference in geneva on wednesday does not imply that the world's first satellite to track flight data from the missing malaysia airlines flight mh370 has been given the go-ahead."				1				6				
5f69bca68bd61e01afde8d9b	315	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> more than half of schools in england are using tablet computers, according to a study from the university of cambridge.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices. The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools. Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations. The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home. Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group. But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil. The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools. The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000. But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results. Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment. But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact. And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families. Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools. ""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said. A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read. It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books. The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people. Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"". About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos. Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children. It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home. Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools. Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home. Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"". The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"". Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on. The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work. ""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  schools are using tablet computers to some extent. but there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices."				1				6

5bdcf08f05ed110001ab2bbf	187	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the all progressives congress is the main opposition party."					2					2

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  india's famous bollywood labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra for the first time."						3			4	2		3

60f571319ee24e52598ecd9a	295	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."					2			6

Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been ""changed forever"". ""It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,"" she said. ""My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared.""

""The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more."" Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August.

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the current council tax system is unfair because it is not linked to current income."				1				6

60c4fece6f2bc6645e911155	190	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> in the early hours of tuesday morning, cynthia garissa woke up in her bedroom in garissa, kenya's capital, garissa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> She had been contemplating the 50 hours she'd just spent crushed inside a tiny cupboard, hidden beneath a pile of clothes, with nothing but a bottle of body lotion to try to quench a raging thirst. The sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears. Cynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia. There have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings. But when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure. ""I'm fine, thanks."" ""Everything is fine now."" ""Thank you for asking."" I am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable. I couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women. These feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity. They are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border. But elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality. Al-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back. Perhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax. At Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: ""Oh, I thought you were carrying guns."" And yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon. For two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy. But Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya. Then, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast. Troops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with ""friendly"" warlords. Since then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya. Revenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere. Then there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation. It has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast. And then there is Greater Somalia. It is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa. Al-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges. By attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area. Not that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite. Yes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town. Surely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support. But overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the militants are not promoting greater somalia."				1				6

60c4fece6f2bc6645e911155	91	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> a row has broken out over whether sepp blatter should be replaced by a member of world governing body fifa.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the fact that Domenico Scala is a dual Swiss/Italian national does not result in a conflict of interest.

Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  steve jobs has been a success, but the iphone has not."			4				5		4	2		3

He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death.

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

5ebae1553421dc07a5fc6673	4	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.

Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships. The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted. Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March. A final decision is not expected until the spring. The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard. She added: ""For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life. ""My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction. ""We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism."" The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will ""consider all options"" for the frigates to ensure ""best financial return for the taxpayer"". A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to ""commercial sensitivity"". Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems. They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  domenico scala is a dual swiss-italian national, as is gianni infantino, one of the five presidential candidates for sepp blatter's position as president. he has been barred from sitting as a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee because of his nationality."						3					1

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

And it goes like this: ""I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."" But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? ""When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon,"" the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. ""I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head,"" lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. ""I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused."" Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. ""Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece,"" he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. ""Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to,"" said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in ""secret"". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella.

Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

6101c49c2727ad36a6c593af	4	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  is becoming a safer place to live, according to new research. boys three times more likely than girls to engage in violent acts."				1				6

Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history. Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  steve jobs has been a success, but the iphone has not."				1								3

Backers, including Blaenau Gwent council, have offered around 320 hectares (800 acres) replacement land. The inquiry has heard conflicting accounts from experts over claims the circuit would damage habitats and plant life by building on the common land. Natural Resources Wales said it was ""difficult to conclude"" that the replacement land was of equal value, but it was not opposing the development overall. But an ecology report presented by the developers said there would be a ""net gain"" in biodiversity because the plans included work to enhance other habitats nearby - which the Gwent wildlife trust argued against.

Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the us has suspended talks with russia over a cessation of hostilities in syria. the us has blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians."					2						1

The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously.

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal. But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons. A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets. ""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said. For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"". It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing. Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."" But the Labour source predicted ""residual tensions"", adding: ""I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering. ""Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  nick clegg is not the same as lord oates."					2			6

606b84e11527ce2103add0a5	200	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  if the people are in poverty, they are more likely to be victims of crime."					2					2

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the bills are directly linked to the situation in Ukraine. they would be triggered by a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders. there are already many Russian citizens in Crimea, and a majority hold Russian passports."					2					2

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"".

It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the all progressives congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. it is the biggest defeat for the peoples democratic party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999."				1				6

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the bills are directly linked to the situation in Ukraine. they would be triggered by a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders. there are already many Russian citizens in Crimea, and a majority hold Russian passports."				1				6

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. ""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. ""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. ""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport. ""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. ""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all."" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. ""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote. ""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes."" Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the fact that Domenico Scala is a dual Swiss/Italian national does not result in a conflict of interest.

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis. Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions. There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea. In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports. Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation. But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart. ""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said. Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control. Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority. The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports. Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required. In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship. The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms. The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm. The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov. Several Russian MPs have also gone to Crimea, including Russian celebrities - former Olympic ice skating champion Irina Rodnina, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and heavyweight boxer Nikolai Valuev.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the bills are directly linked to the situation in Ukraine. they would be triggered by a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders. there are already many Russian citizens in Crimea, and a majority hold Russian passports."				1				6				
611d8cb015d4a95662b91ec3	285	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the us says it has suspended talks with russia over a cessation of hostilities in syria.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: ""The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. ""Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. ""Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,"" Mr Kirby said, admitting that ""this is not a decision that was taken lightly"". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been ""targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy"". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: ""We regret this decision by Washington."" ""Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. ""After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,"" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel ""that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint (US-Russian) Implementation Centre"".

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. ""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. ""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet."" Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. ""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. ""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. ""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled ""Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell"", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films. Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  india's famous bollywood labels are on display in the western state of maharashtra for the first time."				1				6

She had been a ""guiding example"" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday.

The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an ""important landmark"", adding the monarch had served the nation with ""dignity"". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: ""The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be."" The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as ""work-shy William"". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. ""I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role,"" he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a ""work shy"" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised ""but it's not something I take completely to heart"". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was ""the best role model I could have in front of me"". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday ""does not warrant this kind of coverage"" and that the BBC had a ""duty to report, not to celebrate the royals"".

611d915e0221f79080da2884	295	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> young people in edinburgh are more likely to be living in violent crime than girls, according to new research.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. ""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish."" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. ""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. ""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  children from deprived backgrounds are twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls."				1				6

Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit. The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST. Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been ""changed forever"". ""It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,"" she said. ""My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared."" ""We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder,"" she added. ""Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. ""The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more."" Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others. He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death. During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August.

611d915e0221f79080da2884	27	"<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet''in the system of a tax on the system.<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Premise:</strong> A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no ""magic bullet"" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet. ""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. ""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"". He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. ""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""<br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Relationship:</strong> entailment <br> <hr size=""2""><strong>Explanation:</strong>  the current council tax system is unfair because it is not linked to current income."						3					1
