{"id": "97", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> barrow and barrow played out a goalless draw in the fa cup first round.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Media playback is not supported on this device Eighth-tier Taunton were playing their ninth game in this season's competition and were the lowest-ranked side left after Westfields' exit on Monday. Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

{"id": "64", "displayed_text": "<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> iran's ex-wife has called on the british government to appeal against her jailed sentence for plotting mass murder in tehran.<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Premise:</strong> Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in \"secret\". It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed. Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was \"another of these secret trials\". He said: \"Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.\" Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK. He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome \"might come today, it might come next week\". There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was \"more fight in her\" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas. He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was \"unpredictable\" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased. Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: \"I have watched her grow up on Skype. \"She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English. \"Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.\" Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter. Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a \"prisoner of conscience\" who was being held for \"peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association\". Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: \"Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release.\"<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Relationship:</strong> contradiction<br> <hr size=\"2\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>  sentenced to five years in jail for allegedly plotting to topple the government in tehran does not indicate that iran's ex-wife has called on the british government to appeal against her jailed sentence for plotting mass murder in tehran.", "label_annotations": {"Does the explanation justify the answer?": {"Weakly Yes": "2"}, "reason": {"Insufficient justification": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
