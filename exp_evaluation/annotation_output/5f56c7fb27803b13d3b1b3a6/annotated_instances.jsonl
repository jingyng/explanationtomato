Backers, including Blaenau Gwent council, have offered around 320 hectares (800 acres) replacement land. The inquiry has heard conflicting accounts from experts over claims the circuit would damage habitats and plant life by building on the common land.

But an ecology report presented by the developers said there would be a \"net gain\" in biodiversity because the plans included work to enhance other habitats nearby - which the Gwent wildlife trust argued against.
